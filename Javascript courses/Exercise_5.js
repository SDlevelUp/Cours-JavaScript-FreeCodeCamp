// Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
// First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.

// Assign the value 7 to variable a.
// Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.

var a = 9;
